# Rsync time backup

This script offers Time Machine-style backup using rsync. It creates incremental backups of files and directories to the destination of your choice. The backups are structured in a way that makes it easy to recover any file at any point in time.

It should work on Linux, OS X and Windows with Cygwin. The main advantage over Time Machine is the flexibility as it can backup from/to any filesystem and works on any platform. You can also backup, for example, to a Truecrypt drive without any problem.

On OS X, it has a few disadvantages compared to Time Machine - in particular it doesn't auto-start when the backup drive is plugged (though it can be achieved using a launch agent), it requires some knowledge of the command line, and no specific GUI is provided to restore files. Instead files can be restored by using any file explorer, including Finder, or the command line.

# Installation

	git clone https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup

# Usage

	rsync_tmbackup.sh <source> <destination> [excluded-pattern-path]

## Examples
	
* Backup the home folder to backup_drive
	
		rsync_tmbackup.sh /home /mnt/backup_drive  

* Backup with exclusion list:
	
		rsync_tmbackup.sh /home /mnt/backup_drive excluded_patterns.txt

* Backup to remote drive over SSH, on port 2222:

        rsync_tmbackup.sh -p 2222 /home user@example.com:/mnt/backup_drive

* To mimic Time Machine's behaviour, a cron script can be setup to backup at regular interval. For example, the following cron job checks if the drive "/mnt/backup" is currently connected and, if it is, starts the backup. It does this check every 1 hour.

        0 */1 * * * if [[ -d /mnt/backup ]]; then rsync_tmbackup.sh /home /mnt/backup; fi 
	
## Exclude file

An optional exclude file can be provided as a third parameter. It should be compatible with the `--exclude-from` parameter of rsync. See [this tutorial] (https://sites.google.com/site/rsync2u/home/rsync-tutorial/the-exclude-from-option) for more information.

## Rsync options

To display the rsync options that are used for backup, run `./rsync_tmbackup.sh --rsync-get-flags`. It is also possible to add or remove options using the `--rsync-set-flags` option. For example, to exclude backing up permissions and groups:

	rsync_tmbackup --rsync-set-flags "--numeric-ids --links --hard-links --one-file-system --archive --no-perms --no-groups --itemize-changes" /src /dest

# Features

* Each backup is on its own folder named after the current timestamp. Files can be copied and restored directly, without any intermediate tool.

* Backup to remote destinations over SSH.

* Files that haven't changed from one backup to the next are hard-linked to the previous backup so take very little extra space.

* Safety check - the backup will only happen if the destination has explicitly been marked as a backup destination.

* Resume feature - if a backup has failed or was interrupted, the tool will resume from there on the next backup.

* Exclude file - support for pattern-based exclusion via the `--exclude-from` rsync parameter.

* Automatically purge old backups - within 24 hours, all backups are kept. Within one month, the most recent backup for each day is kept. For all previous backups, the most recent of each month is kept.

* "latest" symlink that points to the latest successful backup.

# TODO

* Check source and destination file-system (`df -T /dest`). If one of them is FAT, use the --modify-window rsync parameter (see `man rsync`) with a value of 1 or 2
* Add `--whole-file` arguments on Windows? See http://superuser.com/a/905415/73619

* Minor changes (see TODO comments in the source).
